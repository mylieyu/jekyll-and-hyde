## This issue can be seen across many mediums of the story, such as the original novella itself, a film adaptation, and a comic book all based on the original plotline of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 

Being heavily described in the original novella, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, written by Robert Louis Stevenson, the idea of good versus evil can be seen in the characters between both Jekyll and Hyde. With the public persona of Dr. Jekyll being a nobleman in the story, his curiosity of being able to control the duality of man got the best of him as seen towards the end of the novella. Engulfed in the desire to find this discovery, many irrational decisions were made such as testing his potion to control a person’s good and evil side, on himself. Once he drank the person, soon enough, Jekyll turned into the physical and mental features of Hyde’s character. In this form, many evil impulses can be seen such as Jekyll himself saying that “a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul” (Stevenson 77). It is evident that when Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, all of the “good” characteristics of himself are replaced with more mischievous qualities. With this, Dr. Jekyll’s moral constraints coming from his good side is overshadowed by Hyde’s sinister impulses, causing him to be more irrational, and not have the ability to consciously control his decisions and actions—demonstrating the major duality and internal conflict that Jekyll faces. 

On a different occasion, in a comic book based on The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, like how many other versions included in their adaptations of the story, a scene where Hyde murders an old man appears. Depicted in the comic book, Hyde is described that he is “Suddenly seized with an uncontrollable rage, Hyde struck the old gentleman with his stick and clubbed him to the ground” (“Classics Illustrated -013- Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde”). As Hyde is supposed to portray Jekyll’s evil side,  this demonstrates the extreme behavior that this side of himself can possess. It is evident that the moral constraints that would typically stop someone from doing such harm to any other person, isn’t present in Hyde’s decisions. As Hyde impulsively acts on these decisions with no self-awareness or control, it is with these aspects of Hyde, that differentiates him and Jekyll. Representing good and evil, this shows the ability that one person’s personality can do—further demonstrating the duality of man. 

Like the last two versions of the story, the duality of a man is once again, mainly noted on Jekyll and Hyde. Also seen in the 2003 film, “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” directed by Maurice Phillips, where not only do visual and audio aspects provide more details on this issue between characters but the emotions that the actors express in the film give readers more of a sense of understanding in regard to the split personality that Jekyll has. With more violent scenes, the characteristics of Hyde is much more pronounced in this version compared to the comic book and original novella. In this film adaptation, viewers can clearly see the physical and mental effects that the transformation into Hyde puts on Dr. Jekyll. In one of the final scenes of the movie, Jekyll is seen to be writing his letter to Utterson where he describes the conflict that he is facing saying “The doom that is closing in on us both has already changed and crushed him. As I write, the fights with me, but I will destroy forever the evil that sticks with it be” (“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”). Inferring about the extreme sides of his personality fighting with each other, this puts Jekyll in a negative position about himself. It is with the last motivation of his “good” side that rationalizes that he cannot let Hyde take full control of him. Giving a final sense of Jekyll being self-aware of what is happening to him, he took on the last task of stopping Hyde from living on.
