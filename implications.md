## Everyone has a sense of duality in their personalities, which is why it is important to be aware of yourself.

With one of the main issues that arise in all versions of the story of Jekyll and Hyde, being about the inability to control the duality of yourself, also comes with the implication of good versus evil. Mostly seen in the conflicts between Jekyll and Hyde, it is evident that everyone has a good and evil side to their personalities. Before Jekyll transformed into Hyde entirely, he was known to be a noble public figure who would always be careful of his actions and have moral constraints that stop him from completing his sinister desires. It is the idea of him being self-aware of himself that played a key role in how he presented himself to the public—Jekyll’s good side knew the differences between right and wrong. That being said, with the idea of having a sense of duality and the ability to overshadow the good characteristics of yourself, it is extremely important to be careful of the decisions and actions that you make.
