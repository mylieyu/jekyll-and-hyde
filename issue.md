## Duality of man—The inability to control good and evil impulses.

Based on the original novella and versions of the story, readers can find that many societal issues rise throughout the text of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Despite many of these issues being brought to light, one of the most notable ones is the idea of good versus evil within one’s self. Otherwise known as the duality of someone, it is the main issue of not being able to control these two sides of yourself that are easily illustrated between the characters of Jekyll and Hyde. In their case, Dr. Jekyll’s curiosity of finding a way to control these versions of himself got the best of him, and soon enough, he lost his own ability to control his good and evil impulses, making him turn into Mr. Hyde—the villainous character used to represent the evil characteristics and decisions of Jekyll.
